<h1>ROBOTRAINER</h1>

Quick Start:

This application runs on Python and Flask. After making sure you have both of these things, clone the repository and run the RoboTrainer.py file. It will output a link that you can open up in a browser. The web app runs locally off the user's computer. When you export a new program, it will appear in the same directory as the RoboTrainer.py file.
